                <h1>&#128075; Hi, I'm <em>Leanne!</em></h1>
                <p>
                    I am a first year college student of De La Salle University Dasmarinas, undertaking
                    Bachelor of Science in Information Technology as my undergraduate course. I aspire to
                    become a UI/UX Designer equipped with front-end skills, as well as pursue my hobby of 
                    writing as a sideline. It's an ambitious dream--but that's me.

                            That's right! Singapore and the infamous <strong>merlion</strong>.
                            This is the country where I spent most of my childhood. Despite staying in the Philippines
                            for the meantime to pursue my college degree, I still go back to Singapore every now and then
                            since it is where my parents work. <br> Let me take you on a virtual tour around the small country 
                            through this video from YouTube.

                    <h1>Moving forward... What would I be if not a UI/UX Designer? &#128187;</h1>
                    <h3>Initially, I wanted to become a model.</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a child, I've always dreamt of becoming a model. But painful realizations occured
                        to me while growing up (for instance, my physical appearance does not fit the 
                        beauty standards in the modelling industry). Although it was sad bidding farewell to 
                        my childhood dream, I still love posing for the camera and playing dress as it boosts 
                        my self-confidence and self-esteem.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Then, I began developing a love for writing.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Another hobby of mine is writing. Currently, I'm in the middle of a book project which 
                        I will release around 2023. I know it won't be perfect since it would be my first ever 
                        published book, but I hope the readers who lay their hands on it would appreciate the story 
                        and the characters.
