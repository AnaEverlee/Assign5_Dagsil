Attached in this repository is the HTML and CSS document for my project in Introduction to Computing. 
It's a simple website which gives a quick glimpse into my life as well as links to social networking sites where you can find me.

Note: To check out my simple website, download all the files in one folder. Then, create another folder called 'img' to store the pictures
so the images can load on the webpage.

Thank you ! ^o^
